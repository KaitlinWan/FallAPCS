/*

THIS IS OUR FIRST HOMEWORK :)

Python :
def hi():
    print "Hi"
hi()

1. There's NO FUNTION :O Is the Java code a function?
2. In Java there's a whole EXTRA part preceding it
3. print vs. System.out.println
4. Java has semi-colons -- Python no endings?
5. You have to use colons in Python to declare function
6. You have to CALL the function


Scheme:
(define hi 
     (lambda()
         (display "hello")))

(hi)

1. This is a function once again like python
2. Lots of parenthesis as endings + startings
3. Uses a def like Python but not like Java
4. display vs System.out.println
5. You have to CALL the function
